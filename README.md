To work with this project:
	you will need:
		JDK (NOT JRE!)
			Installation:
				http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html
				or 
				'apt-get install openjdk-7-jdk' on Linux systems that use apt
			Note:
				I use version 7, I suspect version 8 should be OK too

		grails version 3.x
			https://grails.org/download.html
			
	you may want:
		Intellij IDEA (IDE)
			Installation:
				https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/
			Note: 
				* Community version will do, but it doesn't support 
					autocompletion for grails (but it supports groovy)
				* In some cases you may need to set JAVA_HOME environment variable
					to point to the installation location of your JDK
